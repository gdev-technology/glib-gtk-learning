About Rust
----------

- Some people recommend Rust for new projects.
- But: lots of existing C/GObject code, and it's not feasible to rewrite
  everything.
- So: people still need to work and learn C/GObject.
- And: even for a full rewrite, reading and understanding C/GObject code is
  needed to avoid repeating history and past mistakes.

GTK app architecture
--------------------

- Adapt other chapters (intro, further reading, â€¦).
- Add a screenshot or a simplified mockup of gedit.
- Add code examples?
- Adapt for GTK 4.

Misc
----

- Split GLib part into several chapters.

Ideas of new chapters
---------------------

- How to write a library.

Book infrastructure
-------------------

- Smart ref with pageref if on different page: use the varioref package.
- Index.
- Glossary.
- Conventions with more macros.

Or rewrite the book in ConTeXt?!
