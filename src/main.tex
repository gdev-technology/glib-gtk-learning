% Another package for code syntax highlighting is minted. By default minted has better colors for reading the document on a screen, but I think it is possible to have decent colors with listings too, it just requires more configuration. For printing purposes (without colors), I think listings is better. And this document is meant to be printed.

% Frames look nice, but it should be used cautiously. A frame around something means that the "something" is important. A frame will maybe be used later in this book to give a summary of important things. If each piece of code is surrounded by a frame, the important text will not be as highlighted as it should.
