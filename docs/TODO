*.tex files.

GTK app architecture
--------------------

- Adapt other chapters (intro, further reading, â€¦).
- Add a screenshot or a simplified mockup of gedit.
- Add code examples?
- Adapt for GTK 4.
- In the meantime, maybe move it to an appendix.

Misc
----

- Split GLib part into several chapters (needs a quick re-read for page layout
  fine tuning).

Book infrastructure
-------------------

- Smart ref with pageref if on different page: use the varioref package.
- Index.
- Glossary.
- Conventions with more macros.

Or rewrite the book in ConTeXt?!
