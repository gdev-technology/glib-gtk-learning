The GLib/GTK Development Platform - A Getting Started Guide
===========================================================

This document is a guide to get started with the GLib/GTK development platform,
with the C language. It follows a bottom-up approach: it starts with GLib and
ends with GTK, because GTK is based on GLib. There is a focus on best-practices
for the code architecture and providing a high-level overview, giving references
for further reading. So this guide is not comprehensive, but tries to be easily
comprehensible.
